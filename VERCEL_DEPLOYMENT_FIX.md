# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Errors in `lazy-load-fallback.ts`

- Fixed type issues with the Element interface by properly handling HTMLImageElement and HTMLIFrameElement properties
- Added optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access dataset properties
- Used `instanceof` checks instead of property existence checks
- Fixed unused variable warning for 'observer' by using the parameter in the callback

### 2. Type Error in `Contact.tsx`

- Fixed type mismatch where a boolean value was being passed to a function expecting only string values
- Created a properly typed `formDataForSubmission` object that converts the boolean `consultation` value to a string

### 3. Unused Variable Warnings in `vite.config.ts`

- Fixed unused variable warnings by prefixing unused parameters with underscore (`_path`, `_proxyReq`)

## Testing

- Successfully ran the build process with `npm run build`
- All TypeScript errors have been resolved

## Deployment

The application should now deploy successfully on Vercel without TypeScript errors.
